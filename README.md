## 🚀 Features  
- Hybrid architecture combining rule-based logic and ML predictions
- Interactive front-end for users 
- Real-time credit score prediction using a trained **XGBoost** model
- Scenario simulation: Users can test how financial changes impact their credit score
- Personalized feedback and actionable recommendations


## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Frontend:** React.js, Tailwind CSS  
- **Backend:** Flask 
- **Data & ML:** NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost
