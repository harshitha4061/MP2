# Credit Score Optimizer

## Project Description  
**Credit Score Optimizer** is a full-stack web application that assesses a user's financial health and provides personalized recommendations to improve their credit score. It combines **rule-based analysis** with **machine learning** models to deliver real-time insights and "what-if" scenarios for smarter financial decisions.


## Features  
- Hybrid architecture combining rule-based logic and ML predictions
- Interactive front-end for users 
- Real-time credit score prediction using a trained **XGBoost** model
- Scenario simulation: Users can test how financial changes impact their credit score
- Personalized feedback and actionable recommendations


## Technologies Used  
- **Frontend:** React.js, Tailwind CSS  
- **Backend:** Flask 
- **Data & ML:** NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost  


## ML + Rule Engine Breakdown  
- **Rule-Based Engine:**  
  Evaluates user's financial profile against key credit-building guidelines 
  
- **Machine Learning (XGBoost):**  
  Trained on synthetic financial data to predict credit scores and provide model-driven insights.

- **"What-If" Engine:**  
  Allows users to simulate financial changes (e.g., paying down debt, increasing credit limit) and see projected score changes.
